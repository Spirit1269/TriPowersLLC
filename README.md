    1. Install the .NET 8 SDK and a local SQL Server or compatible connection.

    2. cd server

    3. dotnet restore

    4. Provide configuration values (e.g., connection string and JWT key) via appsettings.json or environment variables.

    5. dotnet run ‚Äì launches the API on the default ASP.NET Core ports.

- Serverless Functions (functions/)

    1. Install Node.js (matching the project‚Äôs version) and Azure Functions Core Tools v4.

    2. cd functions

    3. npm install

    4. Set SENDGRID_KEY in the environment for email delivery.

    5. npm start (runs func start) to host the functions on http://localhost:7071.

- Frontend (jobs_react/)

    1. Ensure Node.js 20.x and npm are installed.

    2. cd jobs_react

    3. npm install

    4. npm run dev ‚Äì starts the Vite development server (default http://localhost:5173).

## Required tooling

- .NET 8 SDK

- Node.js 20.x & npm

- Azure Functions Core Tools v4

- (Optional) Local SQL Server or another EF Core‚Äìsupported database

- SendGrid API key for the email function

The API reads its database connection string from the environment. Set the
`DEFAULT_CONNECTION` environment variable to your SQL Server connection string
before running the application. The value in `server/appsettings.json` is only a placeholder.
